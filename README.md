# OpenVPN
This script sets up an OpenVPN client configuration by specifying the VPN server address, port, protocol, username, password, certificate, and key. The script then creates an OpenVPN client configuration file at /etc/openvpn/client.conf and starts the OpenVPN service. Finally, the script verifies the connection status by checking the OpenVPN service status.

Note that this script assumes that you have already installed the OpenVPN client on your system and have the necessary certificates and keys. Also, you should replace the variables with your own values.
